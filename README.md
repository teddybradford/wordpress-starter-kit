# WordPress Development Kit


## Installation

Run `./scripts/install.sh` on a command line to install WordPress and all
development dependencies.


## Development

Run `gulp` on a command line to start the development server and build tasks.


## Deployment

To deploy your WordPress theme to a remote server, rename
`./scripts/deploy.sh.sample` to `./scripts/deploy.sh` and modify the script's
configuration variables appropriately. Now you can run `./scripts/deploy.sh` on
a command line to deploy your local build to the specified remote server.
